# ML_EDA_Regression_Gold
An EDA and Machine Learning Classification project on the IAU Gold ETF demonstrating the use of yfinance, stockstats, Time Series Split, Feature Expansion (SMA, EMA, lagged features, RSI-14, CL=F Close Price, etc.), Model Evaluation and Hyperparameter Tuning. The model predicts Gold price movement (1-up, 0-down) on a weekly basis using a RandomForestClassifier and performs well. The model is to be expanded so as to predict the actual Close Price as well.
